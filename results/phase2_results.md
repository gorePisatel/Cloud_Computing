# Phase 2 Results: Cloud Computing for Big Data

## Root Causes

Based on the provided financial statements and corporate information, several root causes can be identified regarding Kaspi.kz's operational and technological landscape, particularly concerning its current infrastructure model.

### 1. High and Increasing Technology & Product Development Expenses

The Group consistently reports significant and growing expenses related to technology and product development, which could indicate inefficiencies or high costs associated with its current infrastructure and development practices.

**Evidence:**
"Technology & product development (60,807) (88,657) (109,553)"

### 2. Reliance on Proprietary Data Center Services

Kaspi.kz operates its own data center services through Kaspi Cloud LLC, which provides storage, maintenance, and processing of information using server software and equipment. This on-premise model can lead to substantial capital expenditure, operational overhead, and potential scalability limitations compared to cloud alternatives.

**Evidence:**
"Kaspi Cloud LLC is providing data center services to other companies of the Group, that support the storage, maintenance and processing of information using server software and equipment."

### 3. Operational Overhead of Managing Internal Infrastructure

Maintaining and operating a proprietary data center, including server software and equipment, inherently involves significant operational overhead, such as personnel, maintenance, power, and cooling costs, which might detract resources from core product innovation.

**Evidence:**
"Kaspi Cloud LLC is providing data center services to other companies of the Group, that support the storage, maintenance and processing of information using server software and equipment."

### 4. Complexity of Integrated Super App Architecture Driving IT Demands

Kaspi.kz's business model is built around a "two-sided Super App" with deeply integrated payments, marketplace, and fintech platforms. This complex, interconnected architecture likely places high demands on IT infrastructure for data processing, storage, and real-time operations, potentially exacerbating the challenges of an on-premise model.

**Evidence:**
"Kaspi.kz operates a two-sided Super App business model: the Kaspi.kz Super App for consumers and the Kaspi Pay Super App for merchants and entrepreneurs. Our offerings include payments, marketplace and fintech solutions for both consumers and merchants."
"All Marketplace services are integrated with our Fintech and Payments Platforms."
