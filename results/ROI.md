    *   **Net Income:** Monitor the Group's net income as a comprehensive indicator of profitability, influenced by both revenue generation and cost management.
        Evidence: "NET INCOME 588,844 848,770 __1,056,834"
    *   **Cost of Goods and Services:** Analyze changes in this cost category, as cloud optimization can impact the efficiency of delivering products and services.
        Evidence: "Cost of goods and services (82,747) (166,356) (303,858)"
    *   **Technology & Product Development Expenses:** Evaluate these expenses to determine if cloud investments lead to more efficient development cycles or reduced operational costs for technology.
        Evidence: "Technology & product development (60,807) (88,657) (109,553)"
    *   **Infrastructure Costs:** Directly monitor infrastructure costs, which include depreciation of servers, networking equipment, and data centers, to assess the impact of cloud optimization on these expenditures.
        Evidence: "Infrastructure costs include depreciation of servers, networking equipment, data center, kartomats, postomats and payment equipment, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support our technologies and platforms."

2.  **Operational Efficiency Metrics:**
    *   **Loan Approval Process Efficiency:** Measure the speed and accuracy of the automated, centralized, and big data-driven loan approval process, which relies on robust data processing capabilities.
        Evidence: "The Group has developed an automated, centralized and big data- driven proprietary loan approval process that enables it to make instant credit decisions."
    *   **Customer Acquisition and Engagement:** While not a direct cloud metric, the Payments Platform, supported by cloud infrastructure, is identified as a main customer acquisition tool. Monitoring its effectiveness can indirectly reflect cloud value.
        Evidence: "Our Payments Platform is our main customer acquisition tool and we consider it to be fundamental for high levels of customer engagement."
    *   **Data Accuracy and Completeness:** Continuously assess the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in critical financial calculations, such as Expected Credit Loss (ECL), which is supported by IT systems.
        Evidence: "We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the ECL"

## Opportunity-Cost Logic

The opportunity cost of *not* optimizing cloud computing for Kaspi.kz would be the foregone benefits of enhanced operational efficiency, accelerated product innovation, and potential cost savings. Without a focus on optimization, the Group risks incurring higher technology and infrastructure expenses than necessary, diverting resources that could otherwise be invested in strategic growth initiatives. This could lead to slower development cycles for new features and services within the Super App, potentially hindering its ability to maintain a competitive edge and reinforce its powerful network effects.

Furthermore, a lack of cloud optimization could limit the scalability and responsiveness of the Payments, Marketplace, and Fintech Platforms, impacting customer acquisition and engagement. It might also impede the full potential of the Group's "big data-driven proprietary loan approval process" by not maximizing the efficiency of data storage, maintenance, and processing. Ultimately, the decision to forgo cloud optimization could result in missed opportunities for revenue growth, increased operational overhead, and a slower pace of innovation, thereby impacting the Group's overall financial performance and market position.

## Risks of Optimization

Optimizing cloud computing infrastructure and services, while offering significant benefits, also introduces several risks that require careful management.

1.  **Data Accuracy and Completeness Risks:** Changes to cloud environments or data processing workflows could inadvertently compromise the completeness and accuracy of critical underlying data, particularly that used in complex financial models like the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations.
    Evidence: "We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the ECL"
    Evidence: "The Group calculates ECL on a collective basis for loans to ‘customers with shared credit risk characteristics and uses estimates of the Probability of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Exposure at Default (EAD)."

2.  **IT Control Weaknesses:** The process of cloud optimization might expose or exacerbate existing material weaknesses in IT controls. This includes controls over data transfer, information capture and processing, and general IT controls related to user access for relevant IT systems, which are crucial for maintaining financial reporting integrity.
    Evidence: "material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of th..."
    Evidence: "We tested operating effectiveness of certain manual and IT controls over data transfer, information capture and processing in the generation of the underlying statistical data, as well as IT general controls related to user access for the relevant IT systems."

3.  **Security and Fraud Risks:** Any significant alteration to the Group's technological landscape, such as cloud optimization, could potentially introduce new security vulnerabilities or weaken existing safeguards against fraud and other irregularities. The risk of not detecting material misstatement due to fraud is inherently higher, and changes in infrastructure could impact the effectiveness of preventative and detective controls.
    Evidence: "Preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities"
    Evidence: "The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal..."

4.  **Regulatory Compliance Risks:** Cloud optimization must ensure continued adherence to the regulatory requirements of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Market, as well as tax regulations in all operating jurisdictions. Non-compliance could lead to penalties or operational restrictions.
    Evidence: "The Company is regulated by the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan ("NBRK”) and the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of Financial Market."
    Evidence: "The Group provides for taxes for the current period based on the tax accounts maintained and prepared in accordance with the respective tax regulations of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and which may differ from IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB."

5.  **Integration and Interoperability Risks:** Given that all Marketplace services are integrated with the Fintech and Payments Platforms, changes or optimizations within the cloud infrastructure of one platform could inadvertently disrupt the seamless integration and functionality of others, impacting the overall Super App experience.
    Evidence: "All Marketplace services are integrated with our Fintech and Payments Platforms."
