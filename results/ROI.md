# ROI for Cloud Computing for Big Data

## ROI Framing

For a Cloud Computing for Big Data initiative, Return on Investment (ROI) is framed not solely by direct financial gains, but also by strategic advantages, operational efficiencies, and enhanced risk management capabilities. Value is derived from improving the core business model, which relies on powerful network effects and product innovation across its platforms.

Evidence:
"Our business model, reinforced by our highly recognizable brand and continuing product innovation, generates powerful network effects, which has resulted in growth across all our platforms and strong financial performance."

Specifically, value encompasses:
*   **Enhanced Financial Performance**: Direct impact on revenue generation (net fee revenue, interest revenue, retail revenue) and overall net income through optimized operations and new product offerings.
*   **Operational Efficiency**: Reducing technology and product development costs, improving data processing, and streamlining general and administrative expenses.
*   **Strategic Growth and Innovation**: Supporting the two-sided Super App business model for consumers and merchants, fostering product innovation, and strengthening customer acquisition and engagement across Payments, Marketplace, and Fintech platforms.
*   **Improved Risk Management**: Strengthening the ability to assess and manage credit risk, detect fraud, and ensure compliance through better data utilization and processing.

## Opportunity-Cost Logic

The opportunity cost of not investing in cloud computing for big data optimization is the forfeiture of potential benefits that could significantly enhance the Group's competitive position and financial health. Without optimization, the Group risks slower product innovation, which could impede the growth of its Super App ecosystem and the powerful network effects it currently generates. The inability to efficiently process and leverage large volumes of data could lead to less accurate credit risk assessments, potentially resulting in higher expected credit losses on loans to customers. Furthermore, operational inefficiencies due to outdated or insufficient data infrastructure could lead to higher technology and administrative expenses, eroding profit margins. The Group might also miss opportunities to enhance customer acquisition and engagement, which are fundamental to its Payments Platform. In essence, foregoing optimization means sacrificing potential revenue growth, cost savings, and the agility needed to maintain a leading position in its markets, especially given its reliance on digital, data-driven services.

## Risks of Optimization

Optimizing cloud computing for big data, while beneficial, carries inherent risks that must be managed.

*   **Data Accuracy and Completeness**: The effectiveness of big data initiatives heavily relies on the quality of underlying data. If the data used is incomplete or inaccurate, the insights derived and subsequent decisions could be flawed.
    Evidence: "We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the ECL"

*   **IT Control Weaknesses**: The transfer, capture, and processing of information within IT systems are critical. Material weaknesses in these controls, or in IT general controls related to user access, could compromise data integrity and system security during optimization.
    Evidence: "We tested operating effectiveness of certain manual and IT controls over data transfer, information capture and processing in the generation of the underlying statistical data, as well as IT general controls related to user access for the relevant IT systems."
    Evidence: "in addition, material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of th"

*   **Fraud and Error**: Any significant change or optimization to financial reporting or data processing systems introduces a risk of material misstatement due to fraud or error, which could be harder to detect in complex new environments.
    Evidence: "Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion."

*   **Regulatory Compliance**: As a regulated entity, any changes to data handling or processing must remain compliant with the requirements of regulatory bodies. Failure to do so could lead to penalties or operational restrictions.
    Evidence: "The Company is regulated by the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan ("NBRK”) and the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of Financial Market."

*   **Infrastructure Costs**: While optimization aims for efficiency, the initial investment and ongoing maintenance of new cloud and big data infrastructure can be substantial, potentially impacting short-term profitability if not managed effectively.
    Evidence: "Infrastructure costs include depreciation of servers, networking equipment, data center, kartomats, postomats and payment equipment, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support our technologies and platforms."
