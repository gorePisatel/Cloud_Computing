## Key Risks / Bottlenecks

1.  **Significant Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Estimation Complexity:**
    The loss allowance for expected credit loss on loans to customers amounted to KZT 295,843 million as at 31 December 2024. The calculation of ECL involves significant judgment and relies on estimates of Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD), incorporating macroeconomic forward-looking information.
    Evidence: "As disclosed in Note 12 as at 31 December 2024, the loss allowance for expected credit loss ("ECL") on loans to customers amounted to KZT 295,843 million. The Group calculates ECL on a collective basis for loans to ‘customers with shared credit risk characteristics and uses estimates of the Probability of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Exposure at Default (EAD). In addition, the ECL includes significant judgment in incorporating macroeconomic fo..."

2.  **Material Weaknesses in ECL Calculation Controls:**
    Material weaknesses were identified in certain entity-level controls and the control over the review and validation of assumptions within the calculations of macroeconomic factors (PD, LGD, EAD). This required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased effort during the audit.
    Evidence: "in addition, material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of the assumptions within the calculations of the ‘macroeconomic factors PD, LGD, and EAD and the material weaknesses identified, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the calculations of ECL on customer loans with shared credit risk characteristics required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort."

3.  **Data Completeness and Accuracy for ECL:**
    The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation relies on a significant volume of data sourced from relevant Information Technology (IT) systems. Ensuring the completeness and accuracy of this underlying data is critical for reliable financial reporting.
    Evidence: "There is also a significant volume of data used in the ECL which is sourced from relevant Information Technology (IT) systems. in addition, material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of the th... We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the ECL..."

4.  **Operating Effectiveness of IT General Controls and User Access:**
    The operating effectiveness of certain manual and IT controls over data transfer, information capture, and processing in the generation of underlying statistical data, as well as IT general controls related to user access for relevant IT systems, are crucial for data integrity and security.
    Evidence: "We tested operating effectiveness of certain manual and IT controls over data transfer, information capture and processing in the generation of the underlying statistical data, as well as IT general controls related to user access for the relevant IT systems."

## Recommendations

1.  **Strengthen Controls over ECL Assumptions and Validation:**
    Address the identified material weaknesses in entity-level controls and enhance the review and validation processes for assumptions used in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations, particularly for macroeconomic factors like PD, LGD, and EAD.
    Evidence: "in addition, material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of the assumptions within the calculations of the ‘macroeconomic factors PD, LGD, and EAD and the material weaknesses identified..."

2.  **Enhance Data Governance and Quality for ECL:**
    Implement robust data governance frameworks and quality assurance procedures to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the significant volume of data used in ECL calculations, especially data sourced from IT systems.
    Evidence: "There is also a significant volume of data used in the ECL which is sourced from relevant Information Technology (IT) systems. ... We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the ECL..."

3.  **Improve IT General Controls and User Access Management:**
    Review and enhance the operating effectiveness of IT controls related to data transfer, information capture, and processing, along with IT general controls for user access to relevant IT systems, to mitigate risks to data integrity and security.
    Evidence: "We tested operating effectiveness of certain manual and IT controls over data transfer, information capture and processing in the generation of the underlying statistical data, as well as IT general controls related to user access for the relevant IT systems."

4.  **Implement Continuous Monitoring of Credit Risk Models:**
    Given the significant judgment and estimates involved in calculating Expected Credit Loss (ECL) using PD, LGD, and EAD, establish a framework for continuous monitoring and periodic re-evaluation of these models and the underlying macroeconomic factors.
    Evidence: "The Group calculates ECL on a collective basis for loans to ‘customers with shared credit risk characteristics and uses estimates of the Probability of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Exposure at Default (EAD). In addition, the ECL includes significant judgment in incorporating macroeconomic fo..."
