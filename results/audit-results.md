## Key Risks / Bottlenecks

1.  **Significant Judgment and Data Volume in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Calculation:**
    The calculation of the loss allowance for expected credit loss (ECL) on loans to customers, which amounted to KZT 295,843 million as at 31 December 2024, involves significant judgment in incorporating macroeconomic forward-looking information and relies on a substantial volume of data sourced from IT systems.
    Evidence: "As disclosed in Note 12 as at 31 December 2024, the loss allowance for expected credit loss ("ECL") on loans to customers amounted to KZT 295,843 million. The Group calculates ECL on a collective basis for loans to ‘customers with shared credit risk characteristics and uses estimates of the Probability of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Exposure at Default (EAD). In addition, the ECL includes significant judgment in incorporating macroeconomic forward looking information in its impairment calculations using scenarios for direct adjustment of default probabilities. There is also a significant volume of data used in the ECL which is sourced from relevant Information Technology (IT) systems."

2.  **Material Weaknesses in Entity-Level and IT Controls Affecting ECL:**
    Material weaknesses were identified in certain entity-level controls and the control over the review and validation of assumptions within the calculations of macroeconomic factors (PD, LGD, EAD), necessitating a high degree of auditor judgment and effort.
    Evidence: "in addition, material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of the assumptions within the calculations of the ‘macroeconomic factors PD, LGD, and EAD and the material weaknesses identified, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the calculations of ECL on customer loans with shared credit risk characteristics required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort."

3.  **Inherent Risk of Fraud and Misstatement:**
    There is an inherent risk that material misstatements due to fraud may not be detected, as fraud can involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls, making it harder to identify than errors.
    Evidence: "The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."

4.  **Reliance on Local Currency for Fintech Lending and Funding:**
    The Fintech Platform's operations are characterized by lending exclusively in local currency and funding financing products primarily through local currency savings accounts.
    Evidence: "We lend only in locat currency and we fund our financing products mainly using deposit products, which are primarily local currency savings accounts."

## Recommendations

1.  **Strengthen Internal Controls over Data and ECL Calculations:**
    The Group should address the identified material weaknesses in entity-level and IT controls, particularly those related to data transfer, information capture, processing, and the review and validation of assumptions for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculations.
    Evidence: "in addition, material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of the assumptions within the calculations of the ‘macroeconomic factors PD, LGD, and EAD and the material weaknesses identified..." and "We tested operating effectiveness of certain manual and IT controls over data transfer, information capture and processing in the generation of the underlying statistical data, as well as IT general controls related to user access for the relevant IT systems."

2.  **Enhance Review and Validation Processes for Macroeconomic Assumptions:**
    Given the significant judgment involved in ECL calculations, the Group should enhance its processes for reviewing and validating the macroeconomic factors (Probability of Default, Loss Given Default, and Exposure at Default) and their underlying assumptions.
    Evidence: "The Group calculates ECL on a collective basis for loans to ‘customers with shared credit risk characteristics and uses estimates of the Probability of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Exposure at Default (EAD). In addition, the ECL includes significant judgment in incorporating macroeconomic forward looking information in its impairment calculations using scenarios for direct adjustment of default probabilities." and "...material weaknesses were identified in certain entity level controls and ‘the control over the review and validation of the assumptions within the calculations of the ‘macroeconomic factors PD, LGD, and EAD..."

3.  **Maintain Robust Fraud Prevention and Detection Mechanisms:**
    Management should continue to prioritize and strengthen measures for preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities, acknowledging the higher risk associated with fraud.
    Evidence: "Preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities" and "The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."

4.  **Regularly Evaluate and Update Credit Risk Assessment Models:**
    The risk management division should ensure continuous evaluation and updating of credit risk assessment models and the decision-making process to maintain the quality of approved loans.
    Evidence: "The risk management division is responsible for maintaining credit risk assessment models and decision-making process. The quality of approved loans are monitore..." and "Our audit procedures related to the measurement of ECL on customer loans with shared credit characteristics included the following: ‘We involved internal credit specialists to assist us in evaluating and challenging the assumptions and methodologies used to develop the PD, LGD, EAD and the forecasted macroeconomic variables, which included testing the mathematical accuracy of the ECL;"
