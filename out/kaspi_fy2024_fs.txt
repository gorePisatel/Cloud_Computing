INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.
subs ss (the “Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position
‘as at 31 December 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, statementof other
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements, including material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024, and
its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended
in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (“IASB”).
Basis for Opinion
‘We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of
the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’
International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence
Standards) (the “IESBA Code”) together with the ethical requirementsthat are relevant to our
audit of the consolidated financial statements in Republic of Kazakhstan, and we have fulfilled
‘our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most
significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on
these matters.

Why the matter was determined to
be a key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in the audit
‘As disclosed in Note 12 as at
31 December 2024, the loss
allowance for expected credit loss
("ECL") on loans to customers
amounted to KZT 295,843 million.
The Group calculates ECL on a
collective basis for loans to
‘customers with shared credit risk
characteristics and uses estimates of
the Probability of Default (PD), the
Loss Given Default (LGD) and the
Exposure at Default (EAD). In
addition, the ECL includes significant
judgment in incorporating
macroeconomic forward looking
information in its impairment
calculations using scenarios for
direct adjustment of default
probabilities.
There is also a significant volume of
data used in the ECL which is sourced
from relevant Information
Technology (IT) systems. in addition,
material weaknesses were identified
in certain entity level controls and
‘the control over the review and
validation of the ECL models.
Given the significant amount of
judgment used by management to
determine the assumptions within
the calculations of the
‘macroeconomic factors PD, LGD, and
EAD and the material weaknesses
identified, performing audit
procedures to evaluate the
reasonableness of the calculations of
ECL on customer loans with shared
credit risk characteristics required a
high degree of auditor judgment and
an increased extent of effort.
Our audit procedures related to the measurement
of ECL on customer loans with shared credit
characteristics included the following:
‘We involved internal credit specialists to assist
us in evaluating and challenging the
assumptions and methodologies used to
develop the PD, LGD, EAD and the forecasted
macroeconomic variables, which included
testing the mathematical accuracy of the ECL;
We tested the completeness and accuracy of
the underlying data used in the ECL; and
‘+ We tested operating effectiveness of certain
manual and IT controls over data transfer,
information capture and processing in the
generation of the underlying statistical data, as
well as IT general controls related to user
access for the relevant IT systems.

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made
available to us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and
we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated.
When we read the Annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein,
we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated
ncial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the |ASB, and
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whetherdue to
fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do
so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting
process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
‘Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and
to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

{As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
‘* Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
‘© Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
‘* Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
'* Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
/n. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to.
continue as a going concern.
‘* Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.
‘* Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding
the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for
forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
‘We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
‘We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our
auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in
‘our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
‘outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
(in milions of KZT)
1 Corporate information
Overview
Kaspi.kz operates a two-sided Super App business model: the Kaspi.kz Super App for
consumers and the Kaspi Pay Super App for merchants and entrepreneurs. Our offerings
include payments, marketplace and fintech solutions for both consumers and merchants.
Our business model, reinforced by our highly recognizable brand and continuing product
innovation, generates powerful network effects, which has resulted in growth across all our
platforms and strong financial performance.
Kaspi.kz Segments
Our segment reporting is based on our three business platforms:
© Payments: Our Payments Platform facilitates transactions between and among
merchants and consumers. For consumers, our Payments Platform is a highly
convenient way to pay for shopping transactions, regular household bills and make
peer-to-peer payments. For merchants, our Payments Platform enables them to accept
payments online and in-store, issue and instantly settle invoices, pay suppliers and
monitor merchants’ turnover. Our Payments Platform is our main customer acquisition
tool and we consider it to be fundamental for high levels of customer engagement.
Having achieved scale with consumers and merchants, our Payments Platform brings
more value to consumers and merchants.
* Marketplace: Our Marketplace Platform connects both online and offline merchants
with consumers, enabling merchants to increase their sales through and allowing
consumers to purchase a broad selection of products and services from a wide range
of merchants. Marketplace has three main propositions—m-Commerce, e-Commerce
and Kaspi Travel. m-Commerce brings a digital shopping experience to a merchant’s
physical location, while consumers can use e-Commerce to shop anywhere, anytime
and typically with free delivery. Kaspi Travel allows consumers to book domestic and
international flights, domestic rail tickets and international package holidays. All
Marketplace services are integrated with our Fintech and Payments Platforms. Other
than in e-Grocery (which enables consumers to order groceries through the Kaspi.kz
Super App with home delivery) and part of e-Cars (which facilitates buying and selling
used cars), our Marketplace Platform is a “3P” model, enabling third-party merchants
to sell their products directly to consumers.
+ Fintech: Our Fintech Platform provides consumers and merchants with BNPL, finance
and deposit products. All our Fintech services can be accessed through our Super
Apps, fully digitally, with users identified using Kaspi ID biometrics technology. We
lend only in locat currency and we fund our financing products mainly using deposit
products, which are primarily local currency savings accounts. As we add more
opportunities to transact with the Kaspi.kz Super App, we anticipate that consumers
will keep more of their deposits with us.

2. Basis of presentation
Foreign currency translation
3.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Kazakhstani tenge, which is,
also the functional currency of the Company.
The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of
the primary economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). In
preparing the financial statements of each individual entity, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies)
are translated at the appropriate spot rates or exchange rates prevailing at the reporting
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at their spot rates at the date
of the transaction.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary
items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates
at the date when the fair value is determined.
Ratesof exchange
“The exchange rates at the period-end used by the Group in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:
_ 2022 2023 2024
KzT/usD 462.65 454.56 525.11KZT/EUR - 492.86 502.24 546.74
Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the
Group is a going concern, as the Group has the resources to continue in operation for at
least the next twelve months. In making this assessment, management has considered a
wide range of information in relation to present and future economic conditions, including
projections of cash flows, profit and capital resources.
Material accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB as issued by the International Accounting
‘Standards Board.

The Company and its subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in accordance with IFRS
Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB, The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties
and financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of
each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. The Group presents its
statements of financial position in order of liquidity.
Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position only when there is a legally enforceable right
to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to
realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expense are not offset
in the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss unless required or permitted by any
accounting standards or interpretations, and as specifically disclosed in the accounting
policies of the Group.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company
and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the
Company has power over the investee; is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee; and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances
indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power
over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct
the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts
and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company's voting rights in an investee
are sufficient to give it power. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company
‘obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the
subsidiary.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries
not owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. Non-controlling interests are presented
separately in the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss and within equity in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, separately from those attributable to the
shareholders of the Company.

Leases
The Group as lessee
The Group as lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability to pay
future rentals on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The asset will be
amortized over the shorter of the length of the lease and the useful economic life, subject to
review for impairment, and the liability is measured at the present value of future lease
payments discounted at the applicable incremental borrowing rate.
‘The Group recognizes lease payments for short-term leases (leases with lease period of one
year or less) or leases in which the base asset has a low value as an expense during the
lease period. In a long-term lease, assets are recognized at the lease commencement date
as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.
The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability,
lease payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives
received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost, including
value added tax, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash balances with NBRK, reverse
repurchase agreements and unrestricted balances on correspondent accounts and deposits
with other banks with original maturities within three months and are free from contractual
encumbrances. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost.
Mandatory cash balances with NBRK
Mandatory cash balances with NBRK represent funds in correspondent accounts with the
NNBRK and cash which are not available to finance the Group's day to day operations and,
hence, are not considered as part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Due from banks
In the normal course of business, the Group maintains advances and deposits for various
periods of time with other banks. Due from banks initially are recognized at fair value. Due
from banks are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method, and are carried net of allowance for impairment losses.
Property, equipment
Property, equipment and intangible assets, except land and buildings, are carried at
historical cost less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of land which is not
depreciated and any recognized impairment loss, if any. Depreciation on assets under
construction and those not placed in service commences from the date the assets are ready
for their intended use.
18

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
(in millions of KZT)
Depreciation of property, equipment and amortization of intangible assets is charged on the
carrying value of property, equipment and intangible assets and is designed to write off
assets over their useful economic lives. Depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line
basis at 2% per annum for buildings and construction and 10%-33.3% for furniture and
computers and intangible assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the related leased
asset or the lease term. Expenses related to repairs and renewals are charged when
incurred and included in cost of goods and services in the Consolidated Statements of Profit
or Loss, unless they qualify for capitalization.
Buildings and constructions held for use in the supply of services, or for administrative
purposes, are stated in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at their revalued
‘amounts, being the fair value at the date of revaluation determined on the basis of market
data by qualified independent appraisers, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation
and subsequent accumulated impairment losses, Revaluations are performed with sufficient
regularity such that the carrying amounts do not differ materially from those that would be
determined using fair values at the end of the reporting period.
‘An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or
loss arising on the disposal or derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit
or loss.
Investment property
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation
(including property under construction for such purposes). Investment properties are
measured initially at cost, including transaction costs, Subsequent to initial recognition,
investment property is carried at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation and
recognized impairment loss. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
useful life of the assets.
The expenses associated with the registration of ownership, maintenance and valuation of
investment property are included in the cost of goods and services.
The depreciation expense and payment of taxes associated with ownership of investment
property are included in general and administrative expenses. Investment property is
included within other non-financial assets (Note 14).
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net
assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill derived is based on a reasonable
estimation of excess earning power expected from future business development and is
recognized within other non-financial assets (Note 14). If the aggregate of the consideration
transferred is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the
difference is recognized as a gain from bargain purchase in the Consolidated Statements of
Profit or Loss within Other gain (losses).
19

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
{in millions of KZT)
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually at the reporting
period or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not
reversed in a subsequent period. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is
allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination.
On disposal of a subsidiary or the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets (trademarks, brands)
Intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks and brands are reported at cost less
accumulated amortization (where they have finite useful lives) and accumulated impairment
losses.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives at a 10%-33.3% per annum. The estimated useful life and
amortization method are reviewed as at each reporting date, with the effect of any changes
in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The Group performs an
analysis of product life cycle and studies market trends to provide evidence that the product
will generate net cash inflows for the group for an indefinite period. Each period, the useful
lives of such assets are reviewed to determine whether events and circumstances continue
to support an indefinite useful life assessment for the asset. Such assets are tested for
impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication at the end of a reporting
period that the asset may be impaired.
Impairment of non-financial assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it
is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are
also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the
smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation
basis can be identified,
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
{in millions of KZT)
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from
net income before tax as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss because
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible, The Group's liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end
of the reporting period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and the corresponding tax
bases. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences
and deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those
deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are
not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor net income before
tax.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences
associated with such investments and interests are only recognized to the extent that it is
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of
the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates
(and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting
period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences
that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting
period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset and reported net on
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position if:
«The Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current income tax assets against
current income tax liabilities; and
* Deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.

(in millions of KZT)
Current and deferred tax are recognized in profitor loss, except when they relate to items
that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the
current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, respectively.
Provision for Uncertain Tax Positions
‘The Group records a provision for uncertain tax positions if it is probable that the Group will
have to make a payment to tax authorities upon their examination of a tax position. This
provision is measured at the Group's best estimate of the amount expected to be paid.
Provisions are reversed to income in provision for (recovery of) income taxes in the period in
which management determines they are no longer required or as determined by statute.
Taxes Other than Taxes on Income
The Republic of Kazakhstan also has various other taxes that are not taxes on income,
which are assessed on the Group's activities. These taxes are included as a component of
cost of goods and services or general & administrative expenses in the Consolidated
‘Statements of Profit or Loss.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of past events, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation.
‘The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to
settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of
those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material).
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be
recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if itis virtually certain
that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured
reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Consolidated Statements of
Profit or Loss net of any reimbursement.
Share-based compensation
Equity-settled share-based payments (such as “share options”) are measured at the fair
value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-
market-based vesting conditions.
22

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
(in millions of KZT)
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of
the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result
of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the
original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves. Options are
forfeited if the employee leaves the group before the options vest and no additional expense
will be recognised.
‘The Group applies the graded vesting method on granted share options that vest in
instalments over the vesting period. Each installment is separately measured and attributed
to expense over the vesting period.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated statements of the financial
Position but are disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow in settlement is remote. A
contingent asset is not recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position but
disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Financial instruments
‘The Group recognizes financial assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position when it becomes a party to the contractual obligation of the instrument.
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized using
settlement date accounting.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, Transaction costs
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial
liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or
loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are
recognized immediately in profit or loss.
Financial assets
All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 are required to be
measured subsequently at amortized cost or fair value on the basis of the entity's business
model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the
financial assets.
23

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
(in millions of KZT)
Under IFRS 9, all debt financial assets that do not meet a “solely payment of principal and
interest” (“SPPI") criterion, are classified at initial recognition as fair value through profit or
loss ("FVTPL”). Under this criterion, debt instruments that do not correspond to a “basic
lending arrangement”, are measured at FVTPL. For debt financial assets that meet the SPPI
criterion, classification at initial recognition is determined based on the business model
under which these instruments are managed:
+ Financial assets, other than equity investments, that are managed on a “hold to collect”
basis are measured at amortized cost;
+ Financial assets, other than equity investments, that are managed on a “hold to collect
and for sale” basis are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
CFVTOCI");
+ Financial assets, including equity investments, that are managed on another basis,
including trading financial assets, will be measured at FVTPL.
Equity financial assets are required to be classified at initial recognition as FVTPL unless an
irrevocable designation is made to classify an instrument as FVTOCI. For equity investments
classified as FVTOCI, all realised and unrealised gains and losses, except for dividend
income, are recognized in other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification
to profit or loss.
Financial assets, other than equity investments, that are measured subsequently at
amortized cost or at FVTOCI are subject to impairment.
After initial measurement, amortized cost financial assets are measured using the effective
interest rate method, less any impairment losses. The fair value of FVTPL and FVTOCI
financial assets is determined under IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” (IFRS 13"). The fair
value gains or losses for FVTPL are recognized in the statements of profit or loss and for
FVTOCI are recognized in the other comprehensive income, until these instruments are
disposed.
Equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose
fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost less any identified impairment
losses at the end of each reporting period. These instruments are accounted for at fair value
under IFRS 9. The Group has designated these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI
as the Group plans to hold them in the long term for strategic reasons.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts,
interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. All derivative financial instruments are
classified as held for trading and measured at fair value through profit or loss and are not
designated for hedge accounting.
Expected credit loss ("ECL”) measurement — definitions
ECL is a probability-weighted measurement of the present value of future cash shortfalls
(ie., the weighted average of credit losses, with the respective risks of default occurring in a
given time period used as weights). An ECL measurement is unbiased and should be
determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes.
24

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
(in millions of KZT)
‘An ECL measurement of allowance for impairment losses is based on four components used
by the Group:
«Exposure at Default ("EAD") an estimate of exposure at a future default date, taking
into account expected changes in exposure after the reporting date, including
repayments of principal and interest, and expected drawdowns on committed facilities.
+ — Probabilityof Default (“PD’) — an estimate of the likelihood of default to occur over a
given time period.
* Loss Given Default ("LGD”)— an estimate of a loss arising on default. It is based on the
difference between contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect
to receive, including from any collateral. It usually expressed as a percentage of EAD.
+ Discount Rate— a tool to discount an expected loss from the present value at the
reporting date. The discount rate represents the effective interest rate (“EIR”) for the
financial instrument or an approximation thereof.
Default and credit-impaired assets
The financial asset is considered to be in default, or credit impaired, when it meets one or
more of the following criteria:
For loans to customers:
The borrower is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments;
The bank has sold part of borrower's debt with losses;
The loan had experienced a forced restructuring due to a deterioration in borrower
creditworthiness;
The borrower is deceased (retail loans);
The borrower's debt was partially or fully written off due to a significant increase in
credit risk.
For other financial assets, debt securities and due from banks:
* The counterparty or issuer rated at C or less per global rating agencies;
© The counterparty or issuer is more than 30 days past due;
« — The counterparty or issuer has significant deterioration of operating results.
Significant increase in credit risk ("SICR”)
The SICR assessment is performed on an individual basis and on a portfolio basis. SICR for
individually significant loans is assessed on an individual basis by monitoring the triggers
stated below. The criteria used to identify a SICR are monitored and reviewed periodically
for appropriateness by the Group's risk department.
‘The Group considers a financial instrument to have experienced a SICR when one or more
of the following quantitative, qualitative or subsidiary criteria have been met:
For loans to customers:
Increase in lifetime probability of default over defined thresholds;
The number of days past due is more than 30 but less than 90;
External factors affect the solvency of individual groups of individuals (such as natural
disasters, closure of the city-forming enterprise in the region, etc.).

For other financial assets, debt securities and due from banks:
Deterioration of the counterparty’s or issuer's rating by 4 notches;
Deterioration of the counterparty’s or issuer's rating up to CCC+ as per global rating
agencies;
* Deterioration of operating results of the counterparty or issuer.
ECL measurement — description of estimation techniques
General principle
For financial assets that are not purchased or originated credit impaired (“POCI") assets
ECLs are generally measured based on the risk of default over one of two different time
periods, depending on whether the borrower's credit risk has increased significantly in a
three-stage model for ECL measurement:
Stage 1: a group of financial instruments for which no significant increase in the credit risk
level has been recorded since initial recognition and provisions for this group are created as
12-month ECL, and interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the
financial asset.
Stage 2: a group of financial instruments for which a significant increase in the credit risk
level has been recorded since the initial recognition and provisions for which equal ECL for
the instrument's lifetime, and interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying
amount of the financial asset.
Stage 3: a group of credit-impaired financial instruments, for which provisions equal the ECL
amount for the instrument's lifetime, and interest income is accrued based on the carrying
amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance.
ECL for POCI financial assets is always measured on a lifetime basis (Stage 3), and at the
reporting date, the Group only recognizes the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credit
losses since initial recognition.
The Group performs individual assessments for credit-impaired loans.
The Group performs assessments on a portfolio basis for retail loans and loans issued to
small and medium entities ("SMEs"). This approach incorporates aggregating the portfolio.
into homogeneous segments based on borrower-specific information, such as delinquency,
historical data on losses and forward-looking macroeconomic information.

Macroeconomic overlay and macroeconomic scenarios
‘The Group incorporates forward looking information in its impairment calculations via
macroeconomic models, which leads to a direct adjustment of default probabilities. To
develop a future realization of these macroeconomic parameters, the Group uses three
scenarios - a base scenario, an optimistic scenario and a pessimistic scenario. The latter two
scenarios are assigned weights of 18% and 29% (31 December 2023: 25% and 18%). The
base scenario is assigned a weight of 53% (31 December 2023: 57%) in the calculation. For
each scenario a set of values for the relevant macroeconomic variables is used as an input
for the macroeconomic model, which subsequently is applied to adjust the relevant input
parameter.
The List of Macroeconomic Indicators
* Change of nominal exchange rate USD/KZT;
© Change of base rate KZT;
© Unemployment.
Based on the results of annual ECL model validation results, conducted during 4th quarter
2024, the Group introduced changes based on behavior of our portfolios. The main changes
were associated with estimation of LGD for loans that were restructured after default.
Specifically, estimates of cash flow from restructured loans based on assumptions were
substituted by actual cash flows from restructured loans that were collected since start of
loan restructuring program in 2nd quarter of 2022. The effect on ECL was equivalent to a
KZT 12,653 million decrease in loss allowance as at 31 December 2024.
ECL measurement — description of estimation techniques
Principles ofindividual assessment- ECL assessments on an individual basis are done by
weighting the estimates of credit losses for different possible outcomes against the
probabilities of each outcome. The Group defines three possible outcomes for each loan.
Principles of portfolio assessments— to assess the staging of exposure and to measure a
loss allowance on a collective basis, the Group combines its exposures into segments on the
basis of shared credit risk characteristics, so that exposure to risk within a group are
homogeneous.
Examples of shared characteristics include product type and the amount of loan.
Two types of PDs are used to calculate ECLs: 12-month and lifetime PD:
* 12-month PDs - the estimated probability of a default occurring within the next
12 months (or over the remaining life ofa financial instrument if less than 12 months).
This parameter is used to calculate 12-month ECLs. An assessment of a 12-month PD is
based on the latest available historical default data and adjusted for forward-looking
information;
‘+ Lifetime PDs - the estimated probability of a default occurring over the remaining life of
a financial instrument. This parameter is used to calculate lifetime ECLs. An assessment
of a lifetime PD is based on the latest available historic default data and adjusted for
forward looking information.

(in millions of KZT)
To calculate lifetime PD, the Group uses different statistical approaches depending on the
segment and product type, such as the extrapolation of 12-month PDs based on migration
matrixes, developing lifetime PD curves based on the historical default data, and hazard rate
approach.
LGD represents the Group's expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted exposure and
assessed on a collective basis based on the latest available recovery statistics.
For unsecured loans, the Group calculates LGD based on historical NPL collection statistics.
For loans secured by cars, real estate, cash and liquid securities, the Group calculates LGD
based on specific collateral characteristics, such as projected collateral values and historical
sales discounts.
Modification of loans to customers
‘The Group modifies loans to customers in temporary financial difficulty in order to allow a
borrower to recover solvency. Modification of loans is provided in the form of short-term
revision of loan terms and may include the reduction of interest rate, reduction of monthly
payment amount, extension of the loan term, or a combination of these measures that do
not lead to derecognition of the financial asset. After the recovery period, pre-modification
contractual terms are to be applied. The recovery period is agreed in the modification terms,
but in most cases is set for 6 months.
Modification of loan is provided only once and to the borrowers with overdue less than
90 days on a modification date, where sufficient grounds exist to support its recoverability.
During the recovery period, such modified loans are classified to Stage 3, with
corresponding increase in loss allowance. After the recovery period, such modified loans are
allocated to the relevant impairment category, based on its days past due and impairment
methodology.
Restructuring of loans to customers
‘The Group restructures loans of defaulted borrowers by providing an interest free extended
schedule. The new loan schedule has an annuity structure with no grace period. Loans that
were restructured after derecognition are deemed to be POCI (purchased or originated
credit impaired). The difference recognized as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent
that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The Group continues to recognize
restructured impaired loans at Stage 3 for at least 1 year, in case if loan was not
derecognized otherwise and classified as POCI.

Derecognition of financial assets
‘The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows
from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. On derecognition of a financial
asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the
consideration received and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognized in profit or loss. On
derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety, the Group allocates the previous
carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues to recognize under
continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognizes on the basis of the relative fair
values of those parts on the date of the transfer.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, such as due to banks, customer accounts, debt securities issued,
subordinated debt and other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value.
Subsequently amounts due are stated at amortized cost and any difference between
carrying and redemption value is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method as a component of
interest expense.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled, or expired. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another
from the same counterparty on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-
recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference
between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration
paid is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss.
Recognition of interest income and expense
Financial assets include products such as consumer loans, merchant financing, BNPL and car
financing, securities and deposits placed with banks. Interest income from a financial asset
is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the
amount of income can be measured reliably.
Interest income and expense are recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest
method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a
financial asset or a financial liability (or group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of
allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
or receipts (including all fees paid or received that form an integral part of the effective
interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life
of the financial instrument or, (where appropriate) a shorter period to the gross carrying
amount.
Interest earned on assets at fair value is classified within interest income.

All other fees and commissions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15.
Revenue recognition
Net fee revenue ofthe group is comprised of fee revenue from each of our segments,
which is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15, net of rewards. IFRS 15 requires the
application of a “five steps” process to determine the appropriate manner and timing for
revenue recognition. The following accounting policies describe each of these steps for our
material sources of revenue.
Payments fee revenue includes transaction revenue (from both merchants and retail
customers) and membership revenue.
Transaction revenue:
Transaction revenue from merchants, as our customers, is generated pursuant to for
payments processing service agreements. The Company's performance obligation is to
process payments made to or by merchants and the transaction price is determined as
a percentage of the value of goods or services being sold by merchants and/or
otherwise transacted by consumers and therefore processed through Kaspi.kz. The
incentives in form of bonus (rewards) are accounted as variable consideration payable
and decrease the transaction price. Allocation of the transaction price is based on the
relative standalone selling prices and transactions underlying each performance
obligation. Revenue is recognized at point in time when a transaction is processed. The
Company has determined that it is a principal to payments processing services for
merchants that use the Kaspi Payments platform, as it is primarily responsible for
fulfilling the contractual terms because it is primarily responsible for the quality of the
payment processing services and directly deals with the the retail customer and
merchant. In addition, the Company has discretion in establishing the price that it
charges to merchants for the specified services. Therefore, the Company recognizes
revenue of the gross amount of agreed consideration to which it expects to be entitled
in exchange for the services transferred. Transaction fees from merchants are earned
for processing payment services such as bill payments for regular household needs, QR.
‘code payments for purchases both online and in-store, B2B (business to business) and
processing of our debit cards and third-party issued cards through the Kaspi Payments
platform.

Transaction revenue from retail customers, as our customers, is generated pursuant to
debit payment card service agreements. The Company's performance obligation is to
process payments initiated by retall customers. The transaction price is determined as a
percentage of the payment amount and is allocated to each performance obligation
(transaction processing) on a stand alone basis. Revenue is recognized at point in time
When a transaction is processed. The Company is the principal for payment processing
services relating to retail customers’ (debit card holders) use of the Kaspi Payments
platform. As a result, revenue is recognized on a gross basis, as the Company is
primarily responsible for fulfiling the payment processing on its own payments platform
and has discretion in establishing the selling price of the payment processing service to
the retall customer, irrespective of the costs the Company incur in instances where the
‘Company may utilize other payment intermediaries. Transaction fees from customers
using Kaspi Payments platform are earned for processing payment services such as
debit card transactions and P2P payments to other banks’ cards. When using third-
party payments platforms or networks (e.g., Visa/Mastercard), the Company is an
agent for the payment processing services to retail customers (debit card holders) and,
therefore, revenue is recognized on a net basis, as the Company is not primarily
responsible for fulfilling the payment processing on third parties’ payments
platforms/networks and has no discretion in establishing the selling price of the
payment processing service to the retail customer on third party payment
platforms/networks. Transaction fees from customers using third-party payments
platform are earned for processing debit card transactions.
Membership revenue is generated from annual and monthly fees earned during the
period. Membership fee revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the
applicable memberships on a straight-line basis. Membership fees are paid on a
monthly basis or paid up front at the beginning of the applicable membership period by
retail customers and merchants for accessing various Kaspi.kz services. Memberships
are cancellable and non-refundable,

(in millions of KZT).
Marketplace fee revenue includes seller fees paid by merchants from our 3P marketplace
business, Kaspi Travel, advertising and delivery transactions originated during both online
and in store shopping, It also includes revenue from Kolesa group, largest car and real
estate classifieds platform in Kazakhstan, Autoelon.uz- car marketplace and member of the
Kolesa group in Uzbekistan and Digital Classifieds LLC mobile classified app in Azerbaijan.
. 3P Marketplace business fee revenue is generated through merchants, our customer in
this case, selling their products and services directly to retail consumers through
Kaspi.kz SuperApp pursuant to contracts with the Company. The facilitation of transfer
of products and services through the Kaspi.kz Super App from the merchant to the
retail consumer is considered a performance obligation of the Company and the
transaction price is generally determined as a percentage of the value of goods or
services being sold by the merchant to the retail consumer. The incentives in form of
bonus (rewards) are accounted as variable consideration payable and decrease the
transaction price. Allocation of the transaction price is based on the relative standalone
selling price of the transaction service underlying each performance obligation. The
Company recognizes revenue from the merchant when the retail customer obtains
control over the merchant's products or services. The Company is an agent in the
transaction between a merchant and a retail consumer, as the Company does not
obtain control over the specified good or service before it is transferred to the retail
consumer, does not have discretion in establishing the prices for the specified good or
service and is not primarily responsible for fulfilling the obligation to provide the
specified good or service. Revenue is recognized on a net basis at point in time when
the retail customer obtains control over the merchant's products or services.
Fintech fee revenue:
Banking service fees are the main part of Fintech fee revenue and are recognized under
banking service agreements with retail customers, our customers in this case. The
‘Company's performance obligations under these agreements are to provide additional
cancellable banking services, that fall beyond standard services. These services include:
access to a wide network of Kaspi ATMs with cash withdrawals free of charge with
higher limits than general free cash withdrawal limits; 24-hour service line support for
borrowers, transfers of loan amounts between Kaspi customers’ accounts and ability to
use these funds for bill payments, transfers and other transactions via mobile
application; SMS and mobile push notification/reminder services related to loans;
issuance of loan statements/certificates free of charge via mobile application, and other
services. The transaction price is determined as a fixed, monthly fee for access to these
services and is allocated on a single performance obligation basis over the period of the
banking service agreements. The Company is a principal under these agreements, as it
is primarily responsible for fulfilling the performance obligations and has discretion in
establishing the prices for services. As a result, the revenue is recognized on a gross
basis over the period in which the services are provided, typically monthly.

* Membership fees are generated primarily from annual fees paid by retail customers,
our customers in this case, for our Kaspi Red offering and are earned over time.
Membership fee revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the applicable
membership, typically for one year, on a straight-line basis. Membership fees are paid
entirely up front at the beginning of the applicable annual period by customers for
accessing various Kaspi.kz services. Memberships are cancellable but payments are
non-refundable. Since 2023 Membership fees for Fintech are generated only from late
fees paid by Kaspi Red customers as we have removed annual membership fees.
Retail revenue includes revenue from e-Grocery transactions for the sale of products and
related delivery fees and revenue from e-cars transactions for the sale of cars. Retail
revenue is generated by selling products directly to buyers via Kaspi.kz Super App and by
selling cars via Kolesa App. Revenue is initially measured at the amount of consideration to
which the entity expect to be entitled for goods purchased and is recognized at a point in
time upon delivery when control of the goods has transferred to the customer, reduced by
the estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts and rebates. The Company is the
principal in a transaction with an end consumer and earns revenue on a gross basis.
Rewards are designed to change customer behavior and promote daily use of our Super
App and ensure growth in customer engagement across all our platforms. Retail customers
of the Group earn and accumulate bonuses (rewards) for purchases/transactions made with
merchants that are also customers of the Group. Retail customers can then use bonuses
earned for future purchases/transactions. Liabilities to pay bonuses are accrued on a
transactional basis as a percentage from the transaction price of products sold or services
provided and are accounted in Other liabilities (Note 19). They do not have an expiration
and are accounted as 1 bonus = 1 KZT. Bonuses are accounted as variable consideration
paid to customers and do not give rise to a future material right. In accordance with
IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers”these bonuses are presented as a
deduction from revenue. For segment reporting purposes we continue to account for
rewards as selling and marketing expenses and allocate accordingly.
Share capital and share premium
Contributions to share capital are recognized at cost. Non-cash contributions are not
included into the share capital until realized in cash.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business combination,
are deducted from equity net of any related income taxes.
‘Treasury shares repurchased from shareholders are recognized at cost of acquisition. When
such repurchased treasury shares are further sold, any difference between their selling price
and the cost of acquisition is charged to share capital (if positive) or to retained earnings (if
negative). Where repurchased treasury shares are retired, the carrying value thereof is
reduced by the amount paid by the Group at repurchase thereof, with the share capital
respectively reduced by the par value of such retired shares restated, where applicable, for
inflation, and the resulting difference is charged to retained earnings.
Dividends on common shares are recognized in equity as a reduction in the period in which
they are declared. Dividends that are declared after the reporting date are treated as a
subsequent event under IAS 10 “Events after the Reporting Period” (“IAS 10") and disclosed
accordingly.

Equity reserves
The reserves recorded in equity (other comprehensive income) on the Group’s Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position include revaluation reserve of financial assets and other
reserves, which comprise changes in fair value of financial assets at FVTOCI and allowance
for impairment losses for debt instruments measured at FVTOCI, and foreign currency
translation reserve, which is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation
of the net investment in foreign operation.
Retirement and other benefit obligations
In accordance with the requirements of the Republic of Kazakhstan in which the Group
operates, certain percentages of pension payments are withheld from total disbursements to
‘employee to be transferred to pension fund, such that a portion of salary expense is
withheld from the employee and instead paid to a pension fund on behalf of the employee.
This expense is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss in the period in
which the related salaries are earned. Upon retirement, all retirement benefit payments are
made by the pension fund. The Group does not have any pension arrangements separate
from the pension system of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In addition, the Group has no post-
retirement benefits or other significant compensated benefits requiring accrual.
Areas of significant management judgment and sources of estimation
uncertainty
The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to
make estimates, judgments and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgments in applying accounting policies
The critical judgments, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the Group
management has made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial
statements. Significant judgments have been made in the business model assessment,
significant increase in credit risk, models and assumptions used which are discussed in
Note 3 below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of
estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year.

Assessmentof significant increase of credit risk
As explained in Note 3, ECL are measured as an allowance equal to 12-month ECL for Stage
1 assets, or lifetime ECL assets for Stage 2 or Stage 3 assets. An asset moves to Stage 2
when its credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition. IFRS 9 does not
define what constitutes a significant increase in credit risk. In assessing whether the credit
risk of an asset has significantly increased the Group takes into account qualitative and
quantitative, reasonable and supportable, forward looking information.
Incorporation of forward looking information
When measuring ECL, the Group uses reasonable and supportable forward looking
information, which is based on assumptions for the future movement of different economic
drivers and how these drivers will affect credit risk. Refer to Note 26 for more details,
including analysis of the sensitivity of the reported ECL to changes in estimated forward
looking information.
Models and assumptions used
The Group uses various models and assumptions in measuring fair value of financial assets
as well as in estimating ECL. Judgement is applied in identifying the most appropriate model
for each type of asset, as well as for determining the assumptions used in these models,
including assumptions that relate to key drivers of credit risk. See Note 26 for more details
on ECL and Note 24 for more details on fair value measurement.
Fair value measurement and valuation process
In estimating the fair value of a financial asset or a liability, the Group uses market-
‘observable data to the extent it is available and classifying such financial assets as Level 1
or Level 2 instruments. Where such inputs are not available, the Group uses valuation
models to determine the fair value of its financial instruments with respective classification
of such financial assets as Level 3 instruments. Refer to Note 24 for more details on fair
value measurement,
The Group considers that the accounting estimate related to valuation of financial
instruments where quoted markets prices are not available is a key source of estimation
uncertainty because: (i) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it
requires management to make assumptions about interest rates, volatility, exchange rates,
the credit rating of the counterparty, valuation adjustments and specific feature of the
transactions and (ii) the impact that recognizing a change in the valuations would have on
the assets reported on its Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as well as its profit
or loss could be material.
Had the management used different assumptions regarding the interest rates, volatility,
exchange rates, the credit rating of the counterparty and valuation adjustments, a larger or
smaller change in the valuation offinancial instruments where quoted market prices are not
available, would have resulted that could have had a material impact on the Group's
reported net income.

Operating segments are identified based on how the Group manages the business on a day-
to-day basis and the types of products and services provided. Operating segments are
reported in a manner consistent with internal reports, which are reviewed and used by the
management board (who are identified as Chief Operating Decision Makers, "CODM"). The
operating performance measure of each operating segment is revenue and net income.
Costs and operating expenses that are deducted from revenue, include interest expenses
(2022: KZT 278,676 million; 2023: KZT 478,010 million; 2024: KZT 616,116 million) and
provision expenses (2022: KZT 55,210 million; 2023: KZT 79,634 million; 2024:
KZT 113,957 million), both attributable to Fintech Segment, share-based compensation
expenses and other expenses recognized across the segments.
Management believes that other segment expenses are not material for analysis of our
ongoing operations.
Expenses associated with share-based compensation are recognized across the segments.

21, Share-based compensation
In 2021 and 2022, the share option program was expanded to include more senior executives
and other core Group personnel. The share-based awards are used to attract, incentivize and
retain employees over the long-term by the management of the Group.
Share-based compensation expense
‘According to IFRS 2, this accelerates the recognition of compensation expenses resulting in a
higher proportion of expenses being recognized in the early years of overall plan.
GDR Options
The fair value of GDR options at the date of grant is determined using the Black-Scholes
model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed over the five year vesting
period, based on the Group's estimate of the number of GDR options that will eventually vest.
Recipients of GDR options are entitled to receive dividends once GDR options vested and
exercised.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
2022 2023, 2024
Black-Scholes model inputs:
‘Weighted average share price in USD 63.7 673 68.4
Expected volatility 43.5% 42.4% 42.1%
Risk-free rate 3.6% 4.2% 4.3%
Dividend yield 7.0% 7.0% 7.0%
Expected volatility is based on the historical share price volatility over the past 3 years.

22, Commitments and contingencies
In the normal course of business, in order to meet the needs of its customers, the Group
became a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. Guarantees issued
included below represent financial guarantees, where payment is not probable as at the
respective reporting date, and therefore have not been recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.
‘The Group's maximum exposure to credit loss under contingent liabilities and commitments to
extend credit, in the event of non-performance by the other party where all counterclaims,
collateral or security prove valueless, is represented by the contractual amounts of those
instruments.
The Group uses the same credit policy in undertaking contingent commitments as it does for
on-balance instruments.
As at 31 December 2023 and 2024, provision for losses on contingent liabilities were
KZT 35 million and KZT Nil, respectively.
The Group's contingent liabilities and credit commitments comprised the following:

Guarantees issued and similar commitments 558, :
Total contingent liabilities and credit commitments 175,329 293,401
Commitments on loans and unused credit lines represent the Group's revocable commitments
to extend loans within unused credit line limits. Those commitments where the borrower has
to apply each time it wants to draw the credit facility from unused credit lines and the Group
may approve or deny the extension of the credit facility based on the borrower's financial
performance, debt service and other credit risk characteristics are considered revocable. Those
commitments where the Group is contractually obligated with no conditions to extend the loan
are considered to be irrevocable.

Legal proceedings
From time to time and in the normal course of business, claims against the Group are received
from customers and counterparties. Management is of the belief that no material losses will be
incurred and, accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated financial
statements.
Pensions and retirement plans
Employees of the Group receive pension benefits from pension funds in accordance with the
laws and regulations of the Republic of Kazakhstan. As at 31 December 2023 and 2024, the
Group was not liable for any supplementary pensions, post-retirement health care, insurance
benefits, or retirement indemnities to its current or former employees.
Taxes
Due to the presence in Kazakhstani commercial legislation and tax legislation in particular, of
provisions allowing more than one interpretation, and also due to the practice developed in a
generally unstable environment by the tax authorities of making arbitrary judgment of
business activities, if a particular treatment based on management's judgment of the Group's
business activities is to be challenged by the tax authorities, the Group may be assessed
additional taxes, penalties and interest. Such uncertainty may relate to valuation of financial
instruments, loss and impairment provisions and market level for deals’ pricing. The Group
believes that it has already made all tax payments, and therefore no allowance has been made
in the consolidated financial statements. Tax years remain open to review by the tax
authorities for five years.

Assets and liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value
For financial assets and liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than 3 months), it is
assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also
applied to demand deposits and savings accounts without a maturity.
Due from banks
The estimated fair value of term due from banks is determined by discounting the contractual
cash flows using interest rates currently offered for due from banks with similar terms.
Loans to customers
Loans to individual customers are made at fixed rates. The fair value of fixed rate loans has
been estimated by reference to the market rates available at the reporting date for loans with
similar maturity profile.
Due to banks
‘The estimated fair value of due to banks is determined by discounting the contractual cash
flows using interest rates currently offered for due to banks with similar terms.
Customer accounts
The estimated fair value of term deposits is determined by discounting contractual cash flows
using interest rates currently offered for deposits with similar terms. For current accounts
which are non-interest bearing, the Group considers fair value to equal carrying value, which is
equivalent to the amount payable on the balance sheet date.
Debt securities issued, subordinated debt
Debt securities issued and subordinated debt are valued using quoted prices.
Assets and liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value
For financial assets and liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than 3 months), it is
assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also
applied to demand deposits and savings accounts without a maturity.

26. Risk management policy
The Group permanently advances it's risk management environment, to fit up-to-date
challenges and risks the Group is exposed to. The Group is exposed to the following types of
risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Credit risk
‘The Group is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that a customer will be unable to pay
amounts in full when due. The Group's credit risk exposure arises primarily from our consumer
finance business through the Fintech Platform. To manage credit risk during loan origination,
the Group centralized all processes related to decision making, verification and accounting
through it’s headquarters. The Group has developed an automated, centralized and big data-
driven proprietary loan approval process that enables it to make instant credit decisions. The
risk management division is responsible for maintaining credit risk assessment models and
decision-making process. The quality of approved loans are monitored by risk management
division on day-to-day basis with periodical validation of the models.
During the credit decision process, the Group uses proprietary risk algorithms and predictive
credit risk assessment models for the evaluation of the risks of potential borrowers using
statistical modelling based on (i) a wealth of proprietary internal data such as application,
transactional, behavioral, shopping and payment history information, which is supplemented
by (li) external data such as data received from credit bureaus (First Credit Bureau LLP and
State Credit Bureau JSC) and pension centre (the State Pension Payment Centre) with regard
to each customer.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For the Years Ended 31 December 2022, 2023 and 2024
(in millions of KZT)
The additional proprietary data constantly accumulated around the Group's customers’ activity
that enables it to continuously deepen its credit decision process.
The risk management division, in terms of credit risk, consists of independent modelling, anti-
fraud, monitoring and provisioning division.
Maximum Exposure
‘The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk varies significantly and is dependent on both
individual risks and general market economy risks. For financial assets recorded on statements
of financial position, the maximum exposure equals to a carrying value of those assets prior to
any offset or collateral. For financial guarantees and other contingent liabilities the maximum
exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the guarantee
was called on or in the case of commitments, if the loan amount was called on.
‘As at 31 December 2023 and 2024, the maximum exposure to credit risk after offset and
collateral was equal to its carrying value of all financial assets except for loans to customers.
As at 31 December 2023 and 2024, the maximum exposure to credit risk after offset and
collateral of loans to customers were KZT 3,823,734 million and KZT 5,086,464 million,
respectively.
Collateral held as security and other credit enhancements
The Group holds collateral or other credit enhancements to mitigate credit risk associated with
financial assets. The main types of collateral obtained are as follows:
« For reverse repurchase transactions — securities;
* For loans to customers that are secured — charges over real estate properties and
vehicles.
Although, the Group uses collateral as credit enhancement to mitigate its exposure to credit
risk, major part of its loan portfolio is represented by unsecured loans. Thus,
as at 31 December 2023 and 2024, unsecured gross carrying amount of loans to customers
were KZT 4,046,581 million and KZT 5,359,101 million, respectively.
As at 31 December 2023 and 2024, credit impaired loans with a net carrying value of
KZT 26,932 million and KZT 29,418 million, respectively were either fully or partially collateralized,
reflecting the extent to which collateral and other credit enhancements mitigate credit risk.

The liquidity management framework of the Group mainly consists of following instruments:
- Assessment of sufficient level of high quality liquid assets;
- Cash flow forecasting;
- Diversification of funding;
- Social media marketing;

Group and mitigate various risks such as liquidity and reputational risks. The division of social
media marketing covers mass media, social networks, blogs and other sources of information,
available to current or potential customers.

nominal maturity under 2 years. However, 94% of deposits in 2023 were rolled over, which
absent a liquidity event such as a run on the bank, allows the Group to maintain a long-term
stable funding base. The average amount of individuals’ customer accounts balance is.

stability of the funding base,
